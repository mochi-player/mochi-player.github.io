### Translating (W.I.P.)

Do you know another language? Help translate, or help improve our existing translation in your own language!

The recommended way of translating is by using a program called Qt Linquist. It is a program that is part of the Qt toolkit.

#### Installing the program

1. [Download the Qt toolkit](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/){:target="_blank"}.
2. Follow the on screen installation instructions.
3. After installation, open the folder: `<qt install folder>\<qt version>\<msvc folder>\bin`. So for example, if you installed Qt 5.7 (latest version as of this writing) to the default installation folder, you would go to `C:\Qt\5.7\msvc2015_64\bin`.
4. In that folder, double click the program named `linguist.exe`. You may want to create a shortcut to the desktop to avoid looking for it again.

#### Starting translation

Qt uses `.ts` files to save translation files. If you don't know how to generate `.ts` files for your language, please create a new GitHub Issue with the subject "Translating in (language)"

For more information on Qt Linguist, please visit the [Qt Linguist Manual](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/linguist-translators.html){:target="_blank"}.
